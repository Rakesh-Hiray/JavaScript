This file demonstrate the concept of javascript - **Execution Context**

* Everythin in JavaScript happens inside the execution context.
* JacaScript is **Synchronous Single Threaded** language.
* Code Execution:
    * Memory creation phase: allocation of memory for Variables & Functions.
    * Thread Execution Phase: Synchronous code execution.
* Function Invocation:
         When we call a function, it is called function Invocation.
* JS has it's own call stack.
* Global execution context pushed into call stack.
* If the function execution is completed then it will popped out from the stack.
* When the program execution is completed then call stack & execution is gets empty.
