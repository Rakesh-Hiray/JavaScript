* This file demonstrates the concept of the - **_Hoisting in JavaScript_**

* **_Hoisting:_**
* We can access the Variables & Functions before initializing it.
* When we run the program then memory is getting allocated to each and every Variables & Functions inside Execution Context.
* If the variable is not initialized before using then the placeholder _**"undefined"**_ is placed to that variables.
* If we access the function before initialization then in execution context the copy of that function is created.
* Hoisting is being differ for Normal function & Arrow function
* In Arrow function it treates the functions as variables if we used them before initialization.

* This is how hoisting works...!
